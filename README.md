## By the way

Awesome libs used:

- [kbd.pretty](https://github.com/foostan/kbd) by foostan
- [keyswitches.pretty](https://github.com/daprice/keyswitches.pretty) by daprice

Also closest alternatives are:

- [raychengy/fifi](https://github.com/raychengy/fifi_split_keeb): non choc (mx switches)
- [davidphilipbarr/chocorne](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/36keys/tree/master/42Keys/chocorne): non hotswap but choc-spaced corne (you can break off one column so it will be 5x3, but with corne pinky stagger)
